# nodejs_db_hackernoon

This study is a product of of this [tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/setting-up-node-js-with-a-database-part-1-3f2461bdd77f) by *hackernoon* for using `MySQL` from inside a `node.js` app, with small changes:
  - `MariaDB` implementation for `MySQL` is used; and
  - LibreOffice is used to view the database.

## MariaDB setup

Installing and configuring `mariadb` is easy. I've followed [Arch Wiki's article on MariaDB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MariaDB) in this part.
